# Principles and Elements of Design
For a final project, I wanted to write a website with things that I learned in a course I took on Udemy about how to make a website. In the course we went over HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, and much more. Being an art major, I wanted to create a quick reference to the principles and elements of design, and include a quick visual example of each. This would be helpful for those students who are looking for a reference to gain a basic understanding of each principle and element.


The website is a single page application, with a menu up top, and distinct sections for each principle and element. Sometimes there is a simple illustration, or even a picture. I used Bootstrap as my main css framework, and included some jQuery and JavaScript examples found on W3 Schools to give the page a smooth scrolling effect. Each illustration as well as photos were created by myself.

This website took about 20 hours to create.
